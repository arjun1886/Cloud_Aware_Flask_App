# Cloud_Aware_Flask_App

Implemented an orchestrator which automates the process of container creation , termination, request servicing. 
Fault-tolerance, autoscaling and load balancing is implemented as part the orchestrator. The application front end was provided, 
to which users can login and images can be uploaded(which can be upvoted, liked, captioned). Built the backend using Flask (in python) 
and MySQL using REST APIâ€™s which is packaged as separate aforementioned docker containers. The service was deployed on AWS.

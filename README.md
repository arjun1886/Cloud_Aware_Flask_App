# Cloud_Aware_Flask_App

This is the backend for a cloud based web application, which enables people to upload samaritan acts.

The application consists of two containers which are REST Api services- 

1. Container 1 handles user related requests.
2. Container 2 handles requests regarding acts which users want to interact with or create.
3. An orchestrator service was written which handles load balancing, fault tolerance and auto scaling. When a container crashes, it is automatically restarted and when the number of requests increases beyond a threshold, new containers serving the same requests are created, if the number of requests decreases beyond a threshold, the excess containers are killed. Requests are forwarded in a round-robin way to these containers.

Built the backend using Flask and MySQL using REST APIâ€™s which is packaged as separate aforementioned docker containers. The service was deployed on AWS EC2 instances.
